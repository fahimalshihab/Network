# What Is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. Computing devices include everything from a mobile phone to a server. These devices are connected using physical wires such as fiber optics, but they can also be wireless.

# Key Components of a Computer Network

From a broader lens, a computer network is built with two basic blocks: nodes or network devices and links. The links connect two or more nodes with each other.

## 1. Network Devices
Network devices or nodes are computing devices that need to be linked in the network. Some network devices include:

- Devices: Laptops, phones, etc. - what users connect with.
- Servers: Store data and run programs for other devices.
- Routers: Direct data packets to the right destination.
- Switches: Connect multiple devices within a network.
- Gateways: Connect different networks, like a router with internet access.

## 2. Links
Links are the transmission media which can be of two types:

- Wired: Cables like coax, phone lines, and fiber optics carry data.
- Wireless: Uses radio waves for data transmission (Wi-Fi, cellular, etc.).

## 3. Communication protocols
A communication protocol is a set of rules followed by all nodes involved in the information transfer.TCP/IP is a conceptual model that standardizes communication in a modern network. It suggests four functional layers of these communication links:

- Network access layer: This layer defines how the data is physically transferred. It includes how hardware sends data bits through physical wires or fibers.
- Internet layer: This layer is responsible for packaging the data into understandable packets and allowing it to be sent and received.
- Transport layer: This layer enables devices to maintain a conversation by ensuring the connection is valid and stable.
- Application layer: This layer defines how high-level applications can access the network to initiate data transfer.

## 4. Network Defense
Network defenses are essential for protecting data on a network.
Common tools include firewalls, intrusion detection, access control, and anti-DDoS measures.
